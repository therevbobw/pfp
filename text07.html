<h2>The Palatine</h2>
<p>To some this is a place of memories,
<br>more golden than an advert for Irish cider,
<br>friends, a piano playing, later singing.
<br>To others it is just a building.
<br>God we know the power of alcohol.
<br>We pray that you will protect
<br>all who use this drug,
<br>and their families,
<br>and all who share the world with them.</p>
