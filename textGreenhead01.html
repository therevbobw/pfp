<h2>The Bench</h2>
<p>A place within the park,<br>but looking beyond the park,<br>to the street,<br>houses and the hills.</p>
<p>God we thank you
<br>for little spaces of time
<br>carved out from busy days;
<br>spaces of quiet and of remembering.
<br>We pray for travellers on the road,
<br>for their safety,
<br>and for good in their encounters today.
<br>We pray your peace
<br>on every household here.
<br>We thank you for the hills and sky,
<br>and ask your help to keep them safe.</p>
