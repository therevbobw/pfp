To Do, not necessarily in this order...

Get focus, or issue notification, on transition.
New index file with menu of walks - different versions of old index file (renamed) for each walk.
Start to build up a library of real walks.
?When user gets back focus, let him/her know of any missed transitions?
More than one prayer for each spot, randomly chosen, maybe weighted according to history.
   (requires history be stored somehow).
Include walk instructions, based on geolocation data.
If user chooses *and* mobile data connection is present, include multimedia, e.g....
   sounds like geese
   sounds like prayers being spoken
   images like same place at a different time of year (get t-o-y from date).
