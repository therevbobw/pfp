<h2>Hadfield Station</h2>
<p>We pray for each person
<br>who uses this station;
<br>for those who escape paying,
<br>for the people going to the City game,
<br>for commuters, for walkers,
<br>for shoppers,
<br>for old and young,
<br>for good and bad:
<br>they are all loved by you:
<br>show us how to pray for them,
<br>how to hope for all good things
<br>to come to them.</p>
<p>We thank you for all who work
<br>on the railway,
<br>and ask you to keep them safe.</p>
