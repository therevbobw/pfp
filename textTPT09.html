<h2>A Gap in the Trees</h2>
<p>Sometimes we see in fits and starts.
<br>And, to be honest, God,
<br>I don't like it.
<br>I wish it were always clear
<br>where I was and what I had to do.
<br>But even Jesus didn't always know:
<br>I remember his desperate prayer
<br>in the garden, for the cup of suffering
<br>to be taken away.</p>
<p>God, lead us, we pray:
<br>help us to know at least,
<br>the next step.
</p>
