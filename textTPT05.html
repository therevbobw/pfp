<h2>Gypsy Lane Bridge</h2>
<p>God we carry with us
<br>all of the past, its joys and its troubles.
<br>We carry its language - we can't help it.
<br>And 'Gypsies' and 'pikeys' and hostility
<br>are part of our story.
<br>God free us from our hostility
<br>to other human beings.
<br>Set us free to love again.</p>
