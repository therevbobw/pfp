<h2>Torside Crossing</h2>
<p>Here is the place where
<br>power and vulnerability meet,
<br>the motor road crosses the foot road.
<br>And when power and vulnerability meet
<br>we pray for justice, fairness,
<br>and something more generous:
<br>we pray for mercy.
<br>May speeds on the road be slow:
<br>may little children in pink cycle hats
<br>peep safely round the railings
<br>and cross the road in one piece.</p>
<p>We remember Jesus,
<br>led like a lamb to the slaughter,
<br>man without power in that moment,
<br>who knows what it is
<br>to be vulnerable.
<br>God, today,
<br>save all who are vulnerable.</p>
